1) Columnar storage is optimized for read-heavy, analytical workloads — especially queries that: Scan large tables,Select only a small subset of columns
Use filters, aggregates, and joins

2) A column-oriented layout minimizes I/O and allows CPU vectorization (SIMD instructions) on contiguous memory, which makes scans and aggregations much faster than row storage. In internal Google tests, this can lead to up to ~100× performance gains compared with vanilla PostgreSQL without schema or app changes.

3) Instead of manually selecting columns to optimize, AlloyDB can analyze query patterns and automatically populate the column store with columns that yield the biggest benefit. This reduces DBA/engineering effort and ensures the structure adapts over time to the workload.

4) If you’re querying large fact tables with aggregations like SUM, AVG, COUNT or slicing by filters (e.g., dates, categories), the columnar engine dramatically reduces query time and resource usage

5) Queries that join large tables but only touch a few columns will see much less I/O and faster join processing via vectorized execution

Architecture Considerations:

1) Memory settings: Tuning the column store memory vs. database working set is critical for performance.
2) Read Pools: Allocate more columnar memory to read pools for heavy analytical workloads alongside transactional traffic.
3) EXPLAIN Planning: Always validate with EXPLAIN to ensure the engine is being used for critical queries.
4) Disaggregated model: Compute and storage are separate — you can scale CPU and memory independently from storage


Limitations & When NOT to Use It

1) Be aware of these boundaries so you can architect correctly:

2) Not all data types and tables are eligible — unsupported types or non-leaf partitions won’t be loaded.

3) Frequent updates to columnar data can degrade performance (column blocks go invalid and need refresh).

4) For very small tables (e.g., < ~5,000 rows), the planner often prefers row storage.

5) Indexed queries on row data may bypass the columnar engine.

POC may be required.
